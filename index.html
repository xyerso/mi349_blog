                In my view, the immersive experience receive from digital games are much stronger than other media.<br>

                You will feel happy, sad or nervous easily while playing the digital games because they required yourself to engage as a character in their world. Therefore, your emotion will be easily influenced when you obtained a valuable item, was going to face the boss, or lost in a fight during the time since you took yourself into character's position. However, you won't get an emotional crash while watching TV or movie because these media placed you as an audience, and you believe you are viewing in a god mode, you can't sense feelings of characters directly since you hardly substituted into it.<br>

                The immersive experience comparison also works between interactive media and digital games. Although the former set you as the protagonist, it limits the setting strongly, you are only allowable to explore in the designated environment. As the result, digital games give player greater immersive experience than the interactive media because they provide more free space for engagers.<br>

                According to four games which are mentioned, I believed they are considered as games since they demonstrate the characteristic of interactive behaviors and give players immersive experience directly.<br>

                There were several events which left critical marks in history of video games.<br>

                Primarily, “Pong”, as known as starting point of history of video games. “Pong” was a simplified two-dimensional sport game, the player had to bounce a white square to the other side by moving a white bar up and down, and his/her rival had to do the same motion for preventing the white square out of bounds. The game was created by game designer Allan Alcorn, released by company Atari in 1972. In fact, “Pong” was an exercise that Atari gave to Allan while he is attending the company. However, the bar was full of people when the first “Pong” console set up. Later on, “Pong” console was appeared all over the world. Generally, “Pong” was the most successful product from Atari during the early stage, a “Pong” console priced 3500 dollars during that period. However, the original game market wasn’t stable enough because most of players were lacked game literacies at that time, they hardly identified the good and bad parts of a game. Therefore, this instability became the major reason for the later on collapse of Atari.<br>

                Company Nintendo rose after the video games crash of 1983. Nintendo proposed Family Computer (FC) at July of 1983, which quickly attract eyes of different ages in all over the world, based by the high-quality screen and extremely cheap price of itself. (100 dollars). As the consequence, Nintendo became the biggest video games company in a short period. Nevertheless, Nintendo not only succeed by its advanced techniques, but also by smart management strategies. First, Nintendo created a unique product setting, software of itself was put in loaded game cards, which was not suitable with other disks and hardly stolen. Secondly, Nintendo designed amounts of famous video games, such as “Super Mario Brothers “and “The legend of Zelda”. The former was released at 1985, designed by Miyamoto Shigeru, its increased setting of “transport system of tunnel, different layout of landscapes, transform system, puzzle, hidden awards” from the essential setting of “Pac man” which designed by company Bandai Namco. Nintendo gathered these setting elements together, eventually designed the most comfortable games at that period, either suck or pro players could fully enjoy the game. Super Mario Brother was a post for platform action games. It kept the world sales record for twenty years. The later was another peak of Nintendo, Zelda was the first ARPG (action role playing game) in the world. It originally demonstrated the setting of item collection and the structure of the open world. Nowadays, most successful open world games, for instance, World of Warcraft, was studied from the “Zelda”.<br>
